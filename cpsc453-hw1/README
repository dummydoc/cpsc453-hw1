# Homework 1: Generating Fractals, Hexaflake and Koch snowflake

## Build instructions
### macOS
```
 > make -f Makefile.osx
```

## Linux
```
 > make -f Makefile.linux
```

## Controls
### Changing level of recursion
#### Increasing the level of recursion
```
Up arrow key
```
#### Decreasing the level of recursion
```
Down arrow key
```

### Changing fractals

To change between the different fractals use the left and right arrow keys,
the fractals start at the Hexaflake, then Koch snowflake and then both combined.
The fractals loop.
